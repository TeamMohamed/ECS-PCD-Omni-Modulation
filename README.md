## 🧬 Overview

This white paper presents the world’s first comprehensive integration of the **Endocannabinoid System (ECS)** across all **41 recognized Programmed Cell Death (PCD) mechanisms**.

It introduces the **ECS–PCD Omni-Modulation Protocol** — a multi-tiered model that connects cannabinoid signaling with cellular death decisions, immune modulation, and cancer-specific kill switches.
